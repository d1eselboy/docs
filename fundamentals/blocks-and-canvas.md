# Blocks & Canvas

### Object canvas

Every object has a flexible canvas made of simple blocks. Each block is a piece of information that you can freely move around the canvas. You can add any information you like by hitting the `+` button or in-line by typing `/`. Highlight a block to see its size or move it elsewhere on the canvas. To create a column, drag one block to the end of another block.

### **The following blocks are available in this version of Anytype:**

* Text: text, title, heading, subheading, highlighted
* Lists: checkbox, bulleted list, numbered, toggle
* Media: file, picture, video, bookmark, code-snippet, LaTeX
* [objects.md](objects.md "mention"): create new objects (tasks, people, documents) and link to an existing object
* [relations.md](relations.md "mention"): all relations for this object
* Others: line divider, dotted divider

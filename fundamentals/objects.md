# Object

People, Books, Musicians, Documents, Ideas, Places, Numbers, or Files. For instance, a person named "Enda," an essay to write, the music by "Pink Floyd," the film "2001", a town called "Berlin," a year, or just a simple status like "Done". **Everything** inside Anytype is an Object.

### Object Canvas

Every object has a flexible canvas made of simple blocks. Each block is a piece of information that you can freely move around the canvas. You can add any information you like by hitting the `+` button or in-line by typing `/`. Highlight a block to see its size or move it elsewhere on the canvas. To create a column, drag one block to the end of another block.

**The following blocks are available in this version of Anytype:**

* Text: text, title, heading, subheading, highlighted
* Lists: checkbox, bulleted list, numbered, toggle
* Media: file, picture, video, bookmark, code-snippet
* Objects: create new objects (tasks, people, documents), or link to an existing object
* Relations: all relations for this object
* Others: line divider, dotted divider

### **Object Layout**

Layouts help you customize how your object looks. For example, you can align your text blocks, customize the icon type, or change the page width.

**Anytype currently supports three kinds of layout:**

1. **Basic:** a classic view for notes, articles, and docs.
2. **Profile:** designed for contacts, people, and organizations.
3. **Action:** for getting things done. Perfect for tasks and plans.

We have designed layouts to be extendable. In the future, users will be able to make custom layouts too!

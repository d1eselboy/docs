# Set

Bring multiple objects into one view with Sets. You can make a Set for a specific type of object, like seeing every task in one view. Inside a Set, you can sort, filter, and choose a view.

Sets don't **store** objects. They are a way to see a portion of your knowledge graph like objects tagged `Work`. Sets help you sort through and create specific views to work with many objects at once

#### **Creating Sets**

You can create a Set with a + menu in the Home or bottom-left corner or in / menu in editor. After that you need to decide on what you want to see there. For example project management may require Project type, for reading list â€” Book.

From the Store, choose an object type, click "Create," and choose "Create a set."

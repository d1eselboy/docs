# Library

`Library` contains all entities you need for building a knowledge graph. There you will find [type](type/ "mention")s, [template.md](type/template.md "mention")s, and [relations.md](relations.md "mention")s created by you and pre-build by Anytype.

It is a starting point when you want to create a new Type and work with the templates.

{% hint style="warning" %}
You can't delete existing types, templates and relations. However, we will add this ability in the nearest releases.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In the future, you can choose which ones you need, add types made by the community, propose objects to create/remove, and more.

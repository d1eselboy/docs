### Object Graph

Displays a graph representation of the Links and Relations between your objects. You can see the power of Anytype relations, with connections showing how each object relates to another.

To access the Graph Mode, look for the ![](<../.gitbook/assets/graph (1).svg>) icon in the top-left corner from any opened object or just press `âŒ˜ + Option + O` or  `Ctrl + Alt + O`.

You can hover over each object to highlight its connections. Clicking on it will show additional information and options in a side panel.

To pan around the canvas, drag the background.

You can zoom in and out using a touchpad zoom function or by scrolling with a mouse wheel.

Use the search function at the bottom of the panel to the right if you want to find a particular object. Matching objects will be highlighted in the network view.

#### Connections between objects

### Navigation Panel

Since all connections between objects have a certain direction(_from-object_ or _to-object)_, the navigation panel helps to see objects that are connected with the current one in terms of their direction. _Read more about object connections in _[#object-graph](navigation.md#object-graph "mention")

Navigation Panel helps to navigate between objects that have [Object Links](../fundamentals/object/blocks-and-canvas/relations-mentions-and-object-links.md#as-object-link) or [Relations](../fundamentals/relations.md) to each other. Hit ![](../.gitbook/assets/nav.svg) button on the top bar to open Navigation Panel.

The Navigation Panel consists of three blocks:

* **The current object** is the object that is currently in focus
* **Link from** is a list of objects containing a link or relation to the current object
* **Link to** is a list of objects that are referenced in the current object

If you want to change focus from one object to another simply hit this object on the panel. It changes current context, so you can see updated connections according to the current object.

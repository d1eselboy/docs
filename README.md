# Why Anytype?

![Home page](<.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-05 at 18.45.31.png>)

Anytype is next-generation software that works like your brain does. It solves everyday problems while respecting your privacy and data rights. Anytype is a personal knowledge base, a digital brain that allows you to quickly capture, describe, and connect information.

You can use Anytype to create books, tasks, notes, ideas, documents, tools and organize them any way you want. Future versions will allow you to share your work and safely collaborate with others. We want Anytype to be a global repository of knowledge.

## Stands out

So what can we offer you <mark style="background-color:blue;">n</mark><mark style="background-color:purple;">o</mark><mark style="background-color:green;">w</mark>?

### Privacy. Your information encrypted and yours.

Your data gets encrypted and stays on your devices. Data goes directly between them. Nobody can access your data except you.

You can dive into [privacy-and-security.md](how-anytype-works/privacy-and-security.md "mention") for more details
{% endhint %}

### Flexibility. Replace several tools with a single one

Most of the note-taking apps under-powering type of information you create and give you strict possibilities for customisation and limited flows. **With Anytype you can create a system which serves your personal needs.** Do you want a system with different templates and views in different cases? You can make your masters degree space where lessons and courses which are linked with each other, accessible from other places (like tasks) and also can be managed in database-like view? No problem! Getting things done? OCR?&#x20;

Someone finds us an alternative to Notion that isn’t in-depth about the next step of note taking should be. We think so also!

{% hint style="info" %}
Take a look on things that that [community've build already](https://community.anytype.io/t/picture-thread-sets-relations-types-and-templates/1507/65).
{% endhint %}

### Think the way you want. Graph and database approach at the same time

You can think abstract and systematic in the same application. You can create the network of your thoughts connecting things with each other, while a more strict structures like database-view are also easily accessible&#x20;

### Works offline and locally

Everything happens on [device](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs.draft3.pdf) — even when you work with others. You can turn off your WiFi, reduce stress having all your data in the plane/camping/remotely every time. 100% data availability and no need to rely on internet connection

Having everything locally is fast. No server, no lag. &#x20;

### Easy to use

With all the features above you may think that experience will be lacking. But it’s don't. You can use blocks more than 10 types of blocks to create a document you like.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

### It's free

* No storage limits. No upload limits. You use your device storage, and nobody can limit you/&#x20;
* Backup is provided free of charge to all alpha testers. Your objects are encrypted and synced to our cafe nodes. If your device is lost or damaged, you can restore the latest snapshot from our backup node. Data on the backup node is encrypted, and the Anytype team cannot access your data.

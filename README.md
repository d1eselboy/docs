# Introduction

![Home page](<.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-05 at 18.45.31.png>)

Anytype is next-generation software that works like your brain does. It solves everyday problems while respecting your privacy and data rights. Anytype is a personal knowledge base, a digital brain that allows you to quickly capture, describe, and connect information.

You can use Anytype to create books, tasks, notes, ideas, documents, tools and organize them any way you want. Future versions will allow you to share your work and safely collaborate with others. We want Anytype to be a global repository of knowledge.

## Why you need Anytype?

### Privacy & Security

Everything happens on [device](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs.draft3.pdf) â€” even when you work with others.&#x20;

You can collaborate without\
sacrificing your privacy.

* Your data gets stored on your devices and encrypted with a keychain phrase. Nobody can access your data. The keychain phrase is something only you know; you need it to sign in to new devices. If you lose it, Anytype cannot help you recover your dataM . More about [privacy-and-security.md](how-anytype-works/privacy-and-security.md "mention")
* All of your data gets encrypted and backed up. Backup is provided free of charge to all alpha testers. Your objects are encrypted and synced to our cafe nodes. If your device is lost or damaged, you can restore the latest snapshot from our backup node. Data on the backup node is encrypted, and the Anytype team cannot access your data.

# What is Anytype?

![Home page](<.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-05 at 18.45.31.png>)

Anytype is the next-generation software that works as your brain does. It solves everyday problems while respecting your privacy and data rights. Anytype is a personal knowledge base, a digital brain that allows you to capture, describe, and connect information.

You can use Anytype to create books, tasks, notes, ideas, documents, tools and organise them any way you want. Future versions will allow you to share your work and safely collaborate with others. We want Anytype to be a global repository of knowledge.

## Stands out

So what can we offer you <mark style="color:blue;"><mark style="background-color:blue;">n<mark style="background-color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;"><mark style="background-color:purple;">o<mark style="background-color:purple;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;"><mark style="background-color:green;">w<mark style="background-color:green;"></mark>?

### Privacy. Your information is encrypted and yours.

Your data gets encrypted and stays on your devices. Data goes directly between your devices, and  Nobody can access your data except you.

You can dive into [privacy-and-security.md](how-anytype-works/privacy-and-security.md "mention") for more details.
{% endhint %}

### Flexibility. Replace several tools with a single one

Most note-taking apps under-powering the information you create and give you strict possibilities for customisation and limited flows. **With Anytype, you can create a system that serves your personal needs.** Do you want a system with different templates and views in different cases? You can make your study space where lessons and courses are linked, accessible from other places (like tasks) and, managed in a database-like view? No problem! Getting things done? OCR? Easy!

Users find us an alternative to Notion that isn't in-depth about the next step of note-taking. We think so also!

{% hint style="info" %}
Take a look at things that [community has built already](https://community.anytype.io/t/picture-thread-sets-relations-types-and-templates/1507/65).
{% endhint %}

### Think the way you want. Graph and database approach at the same time

You can think abstract and systematic in the same application. You can create the network of your thoughts connecting things, while more strict structures like database-view are also accessible. You can get the best out of every world.

### Works Offline and Locally

Everything happens on-[device](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR7GSQM93Cx5eAg6a6yRzNde1FQv7uL6X1o4k7zrJa3LX/ipfs.draft3.pdf) â€” even when you work with others. You can turn off your WiFi, reduce stress by having all your data in the plane/camping/remotely every time. 100% data availability and no need to rely on internet connection

Working Offline means, No Server => No Lag. &#x20;

### Easy to use

With all the features above, you may think that experience will be lacking. But it does not. You can use blocks more than ten types of blocks to create a document you like.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Check [blocks-and-canvas.md](fundamentals/blocks-and-canvas.md "mention") for more details.
{% endhint %}

### It's free

* No storage limits. No upload limits. You use your device storage, and nobody can limit you/&#x20;
* Backup is provided free of charge to all alpha testers. Your objects are encrypted and synced to our cafe nodes. If your device is lost or damaged, you can restore the latest snapshot from our backup node. Data on the backup node is encrypted, and the Anytype team cannot access your data.

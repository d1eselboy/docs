# Can pages be nested one to another?

Let's look at on example:

> * I have object A.

Answer: **they both starting to have links to each other**.

We have <mark style="background-color:red;">no nesting</mark>  for [objects.md](../fundamentals/objects.md "mention"). So object doesn't physically include/store other objects.

All Anytype structure based on linking between objects. Links are directional, so you know that page A links to â†’ page B. You can make the link in the opposite way if you need that. You can't use classical hierarchy when files belong to folders and folders create a path. But you can make some of the objects Favourite so they will be accessible straight from Home.&#x20;

All objects connections will soon look like an interconnected network:

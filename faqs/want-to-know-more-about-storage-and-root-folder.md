# Want to know more about Storage & Root Folder?

### Updates

All Anytype Updates are backwards compatible, so you don't have to worry about losing data due to updates. The same goes for data that you have during the Alpha.

### Root Folder

The Anytype Root Folder that is variable based on the OS is where all your local data is stored. Currently, it is not possible to change the location of this folder. However, this functionality will be added at a later date.

### Soft Links

Anytype does not have a way to reference files directly from the files system. This is something we are working on to reduce duplication.

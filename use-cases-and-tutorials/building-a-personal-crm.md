# Building a Personal CRM

### Steps



1. To create a CRM, you need to click + on home, choose [sets.md](../fundamentals/sets.md "mention") and set **Contacts** as a source. **Finally, you have made a place for all the people you know! **
2. &#x20;You can now add relations to your content. `Email`, `Phone No.`, `Organisation`, `Relation `and more.
3. For additional customisation, you can have multiple views along with filters to make your content more accessible.&#x20;
   1. **List view** looks better for objects like this.
   2. Add filters by relation **tag**, so you can sort contacts by Organisations or any additional tags you have.&#x20;
   3. You can add images as PageCover or with [relations.md](../fundamentals/relations.md "mention") **attachment**

### Templates

It is handy to create Templates. For example, for a CRM system, you can have templates for the people you know with information pre-filled. E.g. A template that has the tags (Gender, Social Media references) pre-filled.

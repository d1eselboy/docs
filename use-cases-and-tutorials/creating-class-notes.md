# Creating Class Notes

### Steps

1. To create **Notes**, you need to click + on home, choose [sets.md](../fundamentals/sets.md "mention") and set **Note** as a source. **Finally, you have made a place for all your Notes! **
2. &#x20;You can now add relations to your content. `Subject`, `Lecture`, `Professor`, `Date`.
3. For additional customisation, you can have multiple views along with filters to make your content more accessible.&#x20;
   1. **List view** looks better for objects like this.
   2. Add filters by relation **tag**, so you will be able to sort notes by subjects
   3. You can add images as PageCover or with [relations.md](../fundamentals/relations.md "mention") **attachment**

Sets collect all your objects that match given criterion. You can add a new book everywhere inside the Anytype, and it will be shown here!

### Custom type

If you want to create a more comprehensive Note-taking system with several entities inside like Tasks, Mentions and Articles simultaneously, we propose[ creating a new Type](https://doc.anytype.io/intro/fundamentals/type#creating-types) for that.

### Templates

It is handy to create Templates. While creating notes in class or meetings, you don't have the time to layout and add relations every time. So, you can create Templates. E.g. For Subjects with a homework task linked, you can have a template with the relations pre-filled. If there is a subject in which you have to follow a specific pattern to take notes.

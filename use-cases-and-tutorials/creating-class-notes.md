# Creating Class Notes



### Steps



1. To create **Notes**, you need to click + on home, choose [sets.md](../fundamentals/sets.md "mention") and set **Note** as a source. **You have created a place for all your Notes! **
2. &#x20;You can now add relations to your content. `Subject`, `Lecture`, `Professor`, `Date`.
3. For additional customisation, you can have multiple views along with filters to make your content more accessible.&#x20;
   1. **List view** looks better for objects like this.
   2. Add filters by relation **tag**, so you will be able to sort notes by subjects
   3. You can add images as PageCover or with [relations.md](../fundamentals/relations.md "mention") **attachment**

### Customisation

After creating a set of notes for subjects or classes you can also use the **"@" **key to reference these sets on your Learning Dashboard. This will allow you to quickly reference the sets related to your education.

### Templates

It is very useful to create Templates. While creating notes in class or in meetings you don't have the time to layout and add relations every time. So, you can create Templates. E.g. For Subjects that have a homework task linked you can have a template with the relations pre-filled. If there is a subject in which you have to follow a certain pattern to take notes.

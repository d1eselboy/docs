### Steps

1. To create a **Task tracker**, you need to click + on home, choose [sets.md](../fundamentals/sets.md "mention") and set **Task** as a source. That's it. **You just started a task tracker! **
2. So now you can view all Tasks in one place. For the Task list, you may add relations. `Tag` , `Due date` , `Priority` Or any other being useful for your tracker.
3. You can also use filters, sorts, and views like:
   1. Relation `Done` `Is` `Unchecked` so you will see only those that are not done
   2. Create a view Works and Personal with filters `Tag` `contains` `Work` and `Tag` `contains` `Personal` to separate the lists
   3. Make `Due date` `ascending` to see nearest tasks higher

You can create any object **Task** with the `+` button in-row in your Set, in the editor by typing `/Task` , or using `+` from the dashboard. **All of these objects will be shown in this Set.**

Sets collect all your objects that match given criterion. You can add a new book everywhere inside the Anytype, and it will be shown here!

### Custom type

If you don't like** Relations** and **Templates** used in Task, you can [#create-a-type](../fundamentals/type/#create-a-type "mention") that will fit your needs.

1. You need to open [library.md](../fundamentals/library.md "mention") in **Home** screen, which contains all **Types** in Anytype
2. Press "Create a new type."&#x20;
3. In your custom **Type**, you can choose any relation and create a template you want.
4. To create a **Task tracker**, you need to click "Create" â†’ "New Set of objects."&#x20;

### Template

It's convenient to create templates for repeatable tasks with pre-filled options. Like Template related to Work can contain `Tag` `==` `Work` with higher default priority

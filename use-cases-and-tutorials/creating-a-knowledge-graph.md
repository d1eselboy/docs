# Creating a Knowledge Graph

### Steps

1. To create **Notes**, you need to click + on home, choose [sets.md](../fundamentals/sets.md "mention") and set **Note** as a source. **You have created a place for all your Notes! **
2. &#x20;You can now add relations to your content. `Subject`, `Lecture`, `Professor`, `Date`.
3. For additional customisation, you can have multiple views along with filters to make your content more accessible.&#x20;
   1. **List view** looks better for objects like this.
   2. Add filters by relation **tag**, so you will be able to sort notes by subjects
   3. You can add images as PageCover or with [relations.md](../fundamentals/relations.md "mention") **attachment.**

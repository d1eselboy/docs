# Creating a Reading List

### Steps

1. You need to open **Store** in **Home** screen, which contains all **Types** in Anytype.
2. Scroll down and click on **Create New Type** and then create a type with the name **List.**
3. Have a look at **the Relations** and **Template** we propose. You can add more relations later, create another template, but you can't delete existing ones or change an icon. If you need your fully custom type, you need to go back to Store and press "Create a new type." In your custom **Type**, you can choose from the list of **Relations.**
4. To create a **Reading List**, you need to click "Create" -> "New Set of objects."
5. Now that you have created a set to view all your reading content. You can now add relations to your content. `Ratings`, `Pages`, `Progress`, `Author`, `Goodreads Link`.
6. For additional customisation, you can have multiple views along with filters to make your content more accessible.
7. Let's create views for Books, Articles and Blog Posts. Proceed with the Plus symbol next to the **All **view and name your view.
8. To add filters for the view you can use it to filter by tag, so in the Books view you will only see your Objects which have been tagged as Books.

### Template

It is very handy to create templates for each view and object type that you have. E.g. a template for Books will have `Author, Rating, Pages` etc. Whereas a template for Blogs posts or Articles will have the `URL, Topic` and other additional information. Using templates when you have multiple views and filters is the fastest way to add new Information without opening pages.

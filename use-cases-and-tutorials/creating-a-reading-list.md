# Creating a Reading List

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2021-11-09 at 18.54.53.png>)

### Steps

1. To create a **Reading List**, you need to click + on home, choose [sets.md](../fundamentals/sets.md "mention") and set **Book** as a source. That's it, **you have made a place for all your books! **
2. &#x20;You can now add relations to your content. `Ratings`, `Pages`, `Progress`, `Author`, `Goodreads Link`.
3. For additional customisation, you can have multiple views along with filters to make your content more accessible.&#x20;
   1. **The Gallery view** looks better for objects like this.
   2. Add filters by relation **tag**, so you will be able to sort books by themes
   3. You can add images as PageCover or with the [relations.md](../fundamentals/relations.md "mention") **attachment**&#x20;

### Custom type

If you want to create a more broad Reading List with several entities inside like Books and Articles at the same time, we propose to[ ](https://doc.anytype.io/intro/fundamentals/type#creating-types)[#create-a-type](../fundamentals/type/#create-a-type "mention") for that.

### Template

It is convenient to create templates for each view and object type that you have. E.g. a template for Books will have `Author, Rating, Pages` etc. Whereas a template for Blogs posts or Articles will have the `URL, Topic` and other additional Information. Using templates with multiple views and filters is the fastest way to add new Information without opening pages.

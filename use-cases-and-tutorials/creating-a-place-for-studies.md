### Steps

1. Create your object for University or for Course name. There you can make your own inter-linked wiki with documents, files, tasks, and projects related. You can create links to **Courses** and **Modules**, `like Macroeconomics for Business or just Math for example`.
2. Let's create place for your **Class Notes. **You need to click + on home, choose [sets.md](../fundamentals/sets.md "mention") and set **Class Notes** as a source. **Finally, you have made a place for all your lectures and seminars! **
3. You can now add relations you want to see in Set:&#x20;
   1. `Class type: lecture, seminar`
   2. `Сlass: Course or Module name that you've created at step 1`
   3. `Class Type: Lecture, Seminar`
   4. `Tasks: something you need to do related class, like Homework`
   5. `Reflection: re-read what you've created in class, add more relations between objects, and get more understanding of the theme covered`

Sets collect all your objects that match given criterion. You can add a new **Class Note **object everywhere inside the Anytype, and it will be shown in **Class Notes**!

### Custom type

If you want to create a more comprehensive learning system with several entities inside like Courses and Modules in a separate sets, we propose[ ](https://doc.anytype.io/intro/fundamentals/type#creating-types)to [#create-a-type](../fundamentals/type/#create-a-type "mention") for that.

### Templates

It is handy to create Templates. While creating notes in class or meetings, you don't have the time to layout and add relations every time. So, you can chose the Template we build or make your custom to subject in which you have to follow a specific pattern to take notes.
